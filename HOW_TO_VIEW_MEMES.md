## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### If no memes appear:
1. **Check API connection**: Ensure DIAL API is accessible
2. **Verify API key**: Check `.env` file has correct key
3. **Network issues**: Try again later if there are connectivity problems

### If viewer doesn't work:
1. **Install Pillow**: `pip install Pillow`
2. **Use File Explorer**: Manual navigation always works
3. **VS Code Preview**: Built-in image preview in editor

### File format:
- All memes are saved as `.png` files
- Filename format: `meme_XXX_description.png` (with sequential numbering)
- Also includes batch summary: `batch_summary.json`

## 🎨 Example Workflow

1. **Generate memes**:
   ```powershell
   python meme_forge.py
   # or
   python batch_meme_generator.py
   ```

2. **View immediately**:
   ```powershell
   python view_memes.py
   ```

3. **Or check manually**:
   ```powershell
   explorer static\generated
   ```

## 📊 Batch Generation Results

After running `batch_meme_generator.py`, you'll also get:
- `batch_summary.json` - Contains metadata about all generated memes
- Individual `.png` files for each successful generation
- Statistics on success/failure rates
